## ❌ Account Terminated ⚰️

For more than a year, we submitted **lists with tens of thousands of phishing reports**.  
Mostly **crypto airdrop scams with drainer scripts** that dominated search engines and took first positions.  

Our own articles strictly followed Medium’s rules:  
- 🔍 OSINT investigations  
- 🌐 Domain analysis and registrar evidence  
- ✅ No personal data, no violations  

We have nothing to hide — so here is an **almost full export of our account**, across all categories.  

Medium, instead of supporting this work, chose to keep **AI-generated scam spam** published from thousands of unverified accounts.
